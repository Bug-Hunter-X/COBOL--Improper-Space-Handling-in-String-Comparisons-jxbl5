This example demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs involving the handling of spaces and null values in character fields.  The program attempts to check if a customer's name is missing. However, it uses a simple space check that may not be completely reliable. 

The solution addresses this issue by providing a more robust method to handle both spaces and potential null or undefined inputs.
